A two-wheeled balancing robot

## What Am I doing?

This is a prototype just sat on my desk right to see if I can write a two-wheel balancing robot out of a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), a [Pimoroni Explorer pHat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/explorer-phat) and a [Pimoroni Enviro pHat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro-phat). The Pi Zero W has a female header soldered on underneath and all three boards are then mounted directly on a [Pimoroni pHat Stack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/phat-stack). If this goes accordign to plan, I might be able to mount the wheels directly on the pHat Stack...

## Software

Not sure yet, all the libraries I need are in Python, but I'd really like this to run in [Node Red](https://nodered.org/) if I can.
